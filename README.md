# Hi I'm **<span style="color:blue">Tiyani Magomani.</span>**

I am a Developer/Microsoft Dynamics 365 Specialist/Software Engineer who loves programming and solving real problems.
Hobbies or interests traveling, music and continuous Learning new things everyday.

Been in the industry for some time, seen technology trends come and go but the most interesting thing is learning never stops and the technology never stops evolving.
You can try to add a <style> tag at the top of your markdown file with rules to remove the border on <td> and <tr> elements.

But unfortunately I noticed it will only work locally on a preview. Github sanitizes the inline style and script tags

<style>
td, th {
   border: none!important;
}
</style>
